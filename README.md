## IndoorReporting
Indoor Reporting for 5G/LTE/WiFi Test Outputs with QGIS Python. 
If you get a WiFi test by using "https://github.com/emirkulusoy/WiFiScan" and if you would like to turn the output csv file into a vector file, which you can thematically present in QGIS, you can use this script on the QGIS Python Console.

## Prerequisites
Before using this script, ensure that the following are installed:
- QGIS
- QChainage plugin for QGIS

## Configuration
Update the `maindir` variable to the main directory where your CSV files and reference lines are stored.

```python
maindir = '....'
```
